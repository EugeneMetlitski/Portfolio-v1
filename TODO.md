# Very Important
    - Implement animations

# Important
    - Make utils/window-resize emit an event that window size query
    was changed. Get app component to catch the event, and bind
    the state of the sidebar component to the SidebarState class
    in the app component.

# Not Very Important
    - Make the sidenav component use Angular transitions instead of js.
    - Rewrite routing the Angular 7 way

    - Check that all components are only responsible for
    logic for the view and nothing else, all other logic
    is incorporated in services.
    - Go through all the comments
    - Watch the angular videos
